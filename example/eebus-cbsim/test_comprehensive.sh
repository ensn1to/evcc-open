echo "All tests completed. The controlbox now supports graceful shutdown!"
echo "Key improvements:"
echo "- HTTP server runs in goroutine with graceful shutdown"
echo "- Signal handling works correctly"
echo "- Context-based cancellation for all components"
echo "- Proper resource cleanup (websockets, eebus service)"
echo "- 30-second shutdown timeout to prevent hanging"
